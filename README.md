# CountingTriangles

Counts all the triangles that appear in the image. Try it out [here](https://tberic.github.io/CountingTriangles/)

## How to use?

You can add *free nodes* by clicking anywhere on the canvas. Free nodes can be moved around by dragging. You can draw a *line* between two nodes by choosing one node and then clicking on another. You can add *dependent nodes* by clicking on a line - those nodes can only move on the chosen line. You can delete nodes by right clicking on them.

After you're satisfied with the object you've created, you can click on *Triangle visualization* to see all the triangles present in the image.
